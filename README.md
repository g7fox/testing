# Transforming Spawner Preset with only "Nodes" to a "Subpresent"


In `Main/Original Files` u can found the old `Buildings-Armory-TV_Bunker-Examine_Crate_Big_Green.json` witch only links to Nodes. The green wooden box in bunkers use this Spawner Preset only and pick the content from this file.

In the main folder we try to change this Spawner Preset, so that it can spawn different types of items with different damage. It use the NodeTrees from the original file, but split them into different files (Subpresents) with different setting options.
